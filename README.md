## Phase 1
Get it working


## Phase 2
Get it working with a shared environment



### Assembly-wise
  * prokka (annotation)
  * kraken2 (species identification)
  * mlst (multi locus sequence typing)
  * (abricate) (virulence/resistance gene identification)
  * (snippy) (pairwise snp-calling)
  
  
### Group-wise
  * roary (pan and core genome)
  * panito (average nucleotide identity
  * FastTree (phylogenetic tree of core genome)
  * (IQ-tree) (phylogenetic tree of core genome)
