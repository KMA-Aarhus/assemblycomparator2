2.1.2
- Sample pathway enrichment analysis with clusterProfiler which is integrated into the report.
- Considering going away from singularity: Too much maintenance and too little return when it has to work with conda anyway. I haven't completely decided yet, but leaning strongly.

2.1.1
- Simple GC statistics added to output and report 


2.1.0
- Bug and stability issues fixed

2.0.0
- Completely new system based on snakemake using both slurm and singularity
